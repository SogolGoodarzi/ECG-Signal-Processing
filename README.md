# ECG-Signal-Processing

<p align="justify"> An ECG is used to see how the heart is functioning. It mainly records how often the heart beats (heart rate) and how regularly it beats (heart rhythm). It can give us important information, for instance about possible narrowing of the coronary arteries, a heart attack or an irregular heartbeat like atrial fibrillation. </p>

<p align="justify"> A device has been designed to receive this signal and then by connecting the device to a program we can process the received signals and extract some useful information. As we needed information for this project, we have done so much research in different areas so, you can see them in different files attached. </p>

Also, you can download the dataset used for this project in the following link:
